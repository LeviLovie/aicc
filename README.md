AI for Infinity Crosses and Circles (tic-tac-tow with endless board)

## About the game
ICC - Infinity Crosses and Circles (tic-tac-toe). This game was created by me, as result of losing interest in playing regular tic-tac-toe, beacuse there is not a lot of combinations, and i just have memorised them. So i tryed to play the game with endless board, and got a problem - first player will often win, because get 3 in a row is really easy. So i started expirementing with different amounts of crosses and circles in a line. I found two - 5 and 6 (numbers bigger then 5 makes games too long, because players search for long lines of figures, and game goes for too long). And yeah, board isn't 'endless' but it is really bigger then 3 by 3.
